# Effect-of-volacnic-eruption
Project code: Effects of volcanic forcing on global mean temperature based on the historical Tambora eruption
# Study questions

1. How is the cooling affected by the different eruption intensities and lengths? 
2. Can the effects of the eruption be represented by implementing a decrease in solar constant in 0-D EBM?

The effect of volcanic activity is modelled by adding a Gaussian-shaped dip in the solar constant and temperature based on 0D-EBM. We have found that volcanic eruptions caused a decrease in surface temperature on a global scale.
